        <b><i><font color="#800000" face="Arial" size="2">How to deal with unreasonable 
        clients </font></i></b>
        <br />
        <b><font face="Arial" size="4">Keep Their Expectations in Line</font></b><br />
        <br />
        <font face="Arial">Is there a mismatch between your clients’ expectations and 
        the reality of your local market? It’s your job to bring them back to reality.</font><br />
        <br />
        <b><font face="Arial" size="2">BY KELLE SPARTA</font></b><br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">I’m hearing it everywhere: Unreasonable buyers and 
        sellers are on the loose! Buyers read about the weak housing market and assume 
        they’ll find a major bargain, while sellers are still unwilling to accept that 
        inventory is up and their ideal asking price is too high. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">But I’m not here to hold your hand and commiserate 
        about how hard it is to deal with unrealistic clients. In fact, it’s my view 
        that if your clients are being unreasonable, it’s your job as their real estate 
        practitioner to bring them back to reality. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b><font face="Arial">How Expectations Are Set</font></b><br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">First you must acknowledge that your “unreasonable” 
        buyers and sellers are that way for a reason. They got their expectations from 
        somewhere. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">Buyers are inundated with negative coverage of the 
        national housing market from their trusted media outlets, and are often 
        overwhelmed with their choices. Sellers, meanwhile, might be stuck on the 
        selling price of their neighbor’s house three years ago, and can’t come to terms 
        with today’s market realities. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">Both buyers and sellers base their expectations on 
        what they believe to be good information; they don’t intend to be unreasonable. 
        Rather, they believe they are being entirely reasonable based on the information 
        they have. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, in the initial meeting with the clients 
        you need to address their expectations of the market and their expectations of 
        you. Don’t wait until they start to get upset or frustrated with you; it’s too 
        late then. You have to deal with it up front. Here’s how.</font><br />
        <br />
        <b><font face="Arial">Get Buyers to Get Real</font></b><br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">It’s your job to explain to buyers that while there 
        are a lot of houses on the market right now, they don’t need to see all of them 
        to make a good choice. They need to know that you have been previewing the 
        properties in their price range and will show them the houses that meet their 
        needs. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">Tell them that if you understand what they’re 
        looking for, you should be able to find their house within six showings — and 
        you’ll probably find it before then. Inform them that if you haven’t found their 
        house after six houses, then you would like to arrange another meeting to 
        discuss their search criteria in detail to make sure that something hasn’t 
        changed. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">No one wants to waste time. If you can convince 
        buyers that they’re going to find a great house with very little hassle and time 
        wasted, they should be happy to follow your plans. If you can’t convince them, 
        you must accept the fact that you’ll be showing lots and lots of homes before 
        your clients make a purchasing decision. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b><font face="Arial">Get Sellers to Get Real</font></b><br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">Sellers may be happier with their heads in the 
        sand, but it’s practically impossible for them to have missed news and 
        commentary on the softer housing market. Although some markets are exceptions, 
        home owners probably aren’t going to be able to sell their property for as much 
        as they could have sold it five years ago. However, they still will be tempted 
        to “test” the market with a price that’s not going to garner very much buying 
        activity. That’s why it’s so important that you’re prepared to address their 
        assumptions.</font><br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">What’s the best way to bring sellers back to 
        reality? Show them the numbers. Gather the evidence from your local MLS and 
        REALTOR® association to show that a home priced too high will languish on the 
        market. </font>
        <a href="http://www.realtor.org/RMODaily.nsf/pages/News2007111404?OpenDocument">
        <u><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">Calculate the local absorption 
        rate</font></u></a><font face="Times New Roman">, and explain that pricing real 
        estate is based on supply and demand, just like in other industries. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">You also can show the sellers examples of local 
        properties that have stood on the market for six or more months. Do a market 
        analysis of comparable sold homes. Nothing gets sellers more serious, more 
        quickly than seeing the market in action. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">Give the sellers a reasonable expectation of when 
        the house should sell, and tell them that they shouldn’t even think about 
        worrying until after that date. Write that date on a calendar in their home or 
        have them put it in their PDA. Then give them something else to focus on. Walk 
        in with a list of things that they can be doing to improve the value of their 
        home or to help in the marketing. If they’re focusing on a “To Do” list, then 
        they don’t have as much time to sit and wonder why the home hasn’t sold yet.</font><br />
        <br />
        <b><font face="Arial">Prepare Them to Be Mad at You</font></b><br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">Yes, that’s right. In your meetings with sellers, 
        you have to prepare them for the fact that at some point, they may become 
        frustrated or mad at you. When things aren’t going well, people naturally look 
        for a scapegoat, and that scapegoat is often you. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">If you prepare them for the fact that this is 
        likely going to happen — even though you’ve been doing your job well — then they 
        can be alert to avoid it. And, if it </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">does</font></i><font 
            face="Times New Roman"> happen, you can acknowledge that you prepared them 
        for it, which can help to diffuse the situation.</font><br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">You also can diffuse the situation by validating 
        their feelings. This is not the same as agreeing with them; it’s a way to 
        sympathize with their feelings while also correcting their assumptions. For 
        example, say:</font><br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">“I know that you </font><i>
        <font face="Times New Roman">need</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> 
        $400,000, and I’d love to be able to honestly tell you that I can get that for 
        you. Unfortunately, the market will give you only what is fair based on what 
        other sellers are taking. I’d rather tell you the truth now than have you be 
        angry at me later.” </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">As you can see, I started by validating the 
        sellers’ feelings. I </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">would</font></i><font 
            face="Times New Roman"> like to get them $400,000. No one wants to tell 
        sellers that they aren’t going to get what they had hoped for. It costs you 
        nothing to share that with them, and it goes a long way for improving their 
        outlook. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">When you validate their feelings, they can then 
        listen to what you have to say about the facts. If you ignore their feelings, 
        then they will argue with you until the cows come home. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b><font face="Arial">Stuck In Unreasonable Mode?</font></b><br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">If you have clients who won’t budge from 
        unreasonable thinking, then you may have failed to validate their feelings. It 
        sounds mushy but it usually works. Restate how it is that you think they are 
        feeling, and let them know you understand their point of view. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">If that doesn’t work, there is another possibility 
        — They want you to be a miracle worker. It is often useful at this time to throw 
        the decisions back to them. For example:</font><br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">“I’d love to get you the $400,000 that you need, 
        but now that you’ve seen the numbers, I think you can see that this is not 
        likely to happen in the market as it stands. After all, if you were a buyer 
        looking for a house now, would you pay $400,000 for this house when all the 
        others are going for $350,000?”</font><br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">The answer to this question will tell you whether 
        they’re living in denial or not. If they stick to their guns, they are still 
        living in denial. Offer them the option to sleep on it and review the numbers on 
        their own, and then meet again tomorrow when they’ve had a chance to really take 
        in the information. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">If they don’t get real, don’t take the listing. The 
        fastest way to have a roster full of unreasonable clients is to take on listings 
        from sellers who are in denial. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b><font face="Arial">It’s in Your Hands</font></b><br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">As a real estate professional, you’re the authority 
        on your local housing market. That’s one of the most important values you bring 
        to your clients. You must use your communication skills and your ability to 
        interpret real estate data to convey current market conditions and help them 
        make an informed, rational decision. </font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <font face="Times New Roman">When you have clients or prospects that are being 
        unreasonable, it’s your job to help them revise their expectations based on the 
        market reality. If you’re clear about what they can expect, and you do a good 
        job of communicating it, you will be well on your way to a business full of 
        completely reasonable clients.</font><br />
