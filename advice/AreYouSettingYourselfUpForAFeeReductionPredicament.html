        For too many agents, this changed market is a first-time experience. To the 
        veterans, it brings back memories of cycles past. And sellers now have an 
        additional rationale of why an agent should lower his/her commission-after all, 
        “we’re going to lose money because we didn’t sell when the market was at its 
        peak so you, Mr. or Ms. Agent, should help in assuming some of that financial 
        loss.” This may be a new “reasoning,” however, the following situation is 
        probably familiar to most productive agents:</p>
    <p>
        Your listing presentation went smoothly. The sellers seemed receptive, perhaps 
        to the point where you perceived them to be impressed. All that remains is their 
        signature on the listing agreement. And then, the dreaded happens. You hear “The 
        other agent will do it for less” or something else of the sort, which, in 
        effect, translates into, “Lower your commission.”</p>
    <p>
        Conventional wisdom, training and practice have prepared us to overcome 
        objections or handle concerns, both of which are alternate descriptions of 
        “defensive justification”-an attempt to fix the problem. Sometimes it works and 
        at other times it doesn’t. Should we accept this “fact” as the “nature of our 
        business?” Do we continuously strive to improve our “defensive justification” 
        skills? Or, is it time to rethink and reexamine our strategy and focus during 
        the listing presentation? With the big question being: Are we unconsciously 
        setting ourselves up for a fee reduction predicament?</p>
    <p>
        First let’s consider our preference. Throughout life, we may experience a 
        recurring problem. Which do we prefer to do: keep fixing it over and over or do 
        we try to prevent it from happening in the first place? If prevention takes 
        preference over fixing, are we flipping our solution options when it comes to 
        commission issues at the listing presentation? If you anticipate that your 
        preferred commission rate will be questioned or challenged-and if it does happen 
        with predictable or unexpected frequency-entertain the possibility that that 
        predicament may only be a symptom and not the problem to be fixed with defensive 
        justification skills! Your listing presentation, content, focus and delivery may 
        be finely tuned in “fulfilling and exceeding expectations,” however, in striving 
        to achieve that objective, it is very easy to get pulled into and respond to 
        those “expectations.” Herein, may be the core of the problem and an opportunity 
        to shift into a more effective prevention strategy.</p>
    <p>
        Sellers are consumers. The majority are price conscious and comparison shoppers 
        when there is no critical urgency or impulse involved. A familiarity, experience 
        or hearsay will determine what their perception is of a “good deal.” But what is 
        it exactly that they know that we do? What are their perceptions which lead to 
        expectations?</p>
    <p>
        Seller surveys identify “find qualified buyers” as one of the most important 
        services provided by real estate agents. Add to that a small handful of “other 
        services” and we end up with a consumer who initially has a “limited awareness” 
        of the agent’s workload and multi-functionality necessary in achieving a 
        successful sale. This “limited awareness” now leads the Seller to get stuck in 
        an agent selection criteria that is based on how an agent fulfills, or exceeds 
        their expectations in finding/attracting and bringing qualified buyers.</p>
    <p>
        The issue of marketing/advertising is put into the spotlight and if your 
        competition has a comparable plan and schedule, what is the likelihood that the 
        seller will be inclined to actually choose the agent with the lower commission 
        fee? A more pertinent question is the one that we need to ask ourselves. Is the 
        extent and diversity of our marketing a critical gauge of the service value we 
        bring into each successful transaction? Our response should serve as a catalyst 
        for expanded thought on the likelihood of content similarities in listing 
        presentations.</p>
    <p>
        The seller-a consumer-will recognize a better value and no one ever regrets 
        investing in quality. Working from this solid premise will create a foundation 
        from which you will be able to shift your delivery and affect a preventive 
        strategy for seller concerns and objections.</p>
    <p>
        To start that shift, your earliest objective should be to expand the seller’s 
        knowledge of the critical issues and considerations involved in achieving a 
        successful sale. Presenting the seller with a discussion agenda will accomplish 
        that for you. The agenda is a short list that includes items that you anticipate 
        as potential objections or concerns. As examples, the topic of general real 
        estate market conditions will open the door for you to bring up the statistical 
        fact that it takes 120 days to consummate a sale in that market area. That 
        revelation makes a short-term listing agreement an unreasonable condition.</p>
    <p>
        Overpricing can be avoided when the appraisal procedure is explained under the 
        category of the “influence of banks and lending institution” on the sale. 
        Perhaps the most powerful discussion topic to include in your agenda is an 
        overview of the major stages in the sales process.</p>
    <p>
        Here is your opportunity to make a major impact on the seller’s opinions and 
        expectations, which cause concerns or objections. It is an opportunity to 
        differentiate yourself from the competition, rectify any thoughts the seller may 
        have on the simplicity of the process and have them recognize the added value 
        you have as a consultant and project manager. It takes preparation before you 
        apply this prevention strategy. Begin by reviewing your current listing 
        presentation and identify items, which, in all probability, are also mentioned 
        or focused on by your competition.</p>
    <p>
        Consider these as a reinforcement of the seller’s opinion that “all agents are 
        the same.” Position and regard these issues as a “given” and a fulfillment of 
        the seller’s expectations. More and better of the same may exceed the seller’s 
        expectations but, it does not pull them out of their restricted “limited 
        awareness.”</p>
    <p>
        The competitive edge is developed by educating the seller on and about the 
        entire sales process and the critical functions you perform from start to 
        finish. Before you can do that it is necessary to go through an exercise of 
        self-appreciation. It is not unusual for agents to grossly underestimate the 
        amount of time they put into an average transaction until they break down the 
        sales process into benchmark events. Consider the following example of 
        benchmarks and give each one a time value.</p>
    <p>
        Remember to give yourself credit for being involved in each phase and in some 
        capacity as a consultant, facilitator, monitor or problem solver. Odds are that 
        you will end up in excess of 100 hours.</p>
    <p>
        1) Prepare for the listing presentation<br />
        2) The listing presentation<br />
        3) Customized marketing plan<br />
        4) Implementation of the marketing plan and initial feedback<br />
        5) Buyer screening and interviews<br />
        6) Showing appointments<br />
        7) Getting and presenting offers<br />
        8) Negotiations<br />
        9) Agreement and into formal contract<br />
        10) Satisfaction of contract contingencies<br />
        11) Appraisal, structural/engineering inspections<br />
        12) Mortgage approval process<br />
        13) Closing/settlement date established<br />
        14) Final walk-through inspection and at last<br />
        15) The closing/settlement.</p>
    <p>
        Yes, your competition may be doing all of the above but are they mentioning and 
        establishing these as an agent’s true service value in a real estate 
        transaction?</p>
    <p>
        Probably not, because it is estimated that the bulk of most agents’ listing 
        presentations revolve around or focus on marketing/advertising. Is your job 
        almost done the minute you find a qualified buyer? It may seem so to the 
        superficially informed Seller. With the exception of handling some odds and ends 
        paperwork, they may think your next function is to collect a hefty commission 
        check. You know it isn’t so because getting it together, keeping it together and 
        running smoothly to closing/settlement places a big demand on your time and 
        application of knowledge, expertise and skills. Add to that your ability to 
        counsel and guide the seller in making the best pricing decision and the entire 
        scope of what you do to earn a commission becomes evident.</p>
    <p>
        Sellers, like most consumers, will pay more for something that they are 
        convinced is of better quality and value. You deserve every cent of your 
        preferred commission rate because you are different, you are better. It’s time 
        for sellers to become aware of and appreciate the extent and importance of your 
        services. It’s up to you to make sure that they do. Bring them out of their 
        “Limited Awareness” box at your next and subsequent listing presentations.</p>
