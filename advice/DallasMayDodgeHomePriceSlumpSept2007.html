    <strong>Moody&#39;s: Dallas may dodge home price slump </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Dallas will probably dodge home price declines as a result of the housing 
    shakeout, a new forecast predicts. 
</p>
<p>
    The latest residential outlook from Moody&#39;s Economy.com says more than 
    three-fourths of U.S. housing markets will suffer drops in prices.
</p>
<p>
    But the Dallas area will continue to see modest gains in median home prices, the 
    research firm predicts. 
</p>
<p>
    Moody&#39;s anticipates that nationwide, home prices will fall by almost 8 percent 
    by the time the housing downturn bottoms out.
</p>
<p>
    But prices are forecast to keep rising by about 3 percent in Dallas over the 
    next couple of years, says Moody&#39;s researcher Ed Friedman. Other Texas cities, 
    including Houston, Austin and San Antonio, may also avoid home price declines.
</p>
<p>
   &quot;Texas does so well for a variety of reasons,&quot; Mr. Friedman said. &quot;It didn&#39;t 
    have as much of a big housing boom, so less of a bust.
</p>
<p>
    &quot;More important, the overall Texas economy, metro by metro, is doing better than 
    the U.S. as a whole,&quot; he said.
</p>
<p>
    Brownsville and Harlingen top the nationwide list of cities Moody&#39;s anticipates 
    will see housing appreciation in the next two years, with prices expected to 
    rise almost 8 percent. Killeen is next in line, with a forecast of 4.6 percent 
    price gains.
</p>
<p>
    Moody&#39;s forecast calls for the Fort Worth area to see about a 2 percent drop in 
    home sales prices.
</p>
<p>
    The largest declines in residential prices will be in California, Florida, 
    Nevada and Michigan markets, the report said. The north-central California city 
    of Stockton has the biggest forecast price fall at 25 percent.
</p>
<p>
    Moody&#39;s forecast for Dallas home prices is consistent with other recent upbeat 
    reports.
</p>
<p>
    An August report from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight found 
    that home prices in the Dallas area were up about 5 percent at midyear compared 
    with the second quarter of 2006.
</p>
<p>
    Earlier reports by Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s/Case-Shiller estimated that Dallas-area 
    home prices were up 1.6 percent from a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
    And forecasts from one of the nation&#39;s largest mortgage insurers, PMI Group, say 
    that the Dallas area is among the U.S. cities least likely to see a home price 
    drop.
