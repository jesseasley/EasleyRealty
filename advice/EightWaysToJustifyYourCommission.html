    In the old days (more than ten years ago) we never had to justify our 
    commissions to anyone. Since we controlled information about the inventory<!--more-->&nbsp;via 
    the multiple listing service sellers had to pay whatever we asked or they could 
    try and sell their homes themselves.Thanks to the availability of listings over 
    the Internet and the rising prices of homes across the country, over the past 
    ten years consumers are increasingly questioning the value of the commissions 
    paid to real estate professionals. Even the federal government is looking into 
    how we are paid because of the prevalent myth that agents all receive about six 
    percent of the sales price of any house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">
    While most real estate professionals have always earned their fee through hard 
    work, saving time for their clients and by reducing their liability, today we 
    have to explain our value if we want to be fairly compensated. Because the 
    assault on commissions is a relatively new phenomenon, many of us are like fish 
    out of water when it comes to explaining why we should be paid what we’re worth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">
    Here are eight tips to help explain your value to clients from my new book “111 
    Ways to Justifying Your Commission:”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">
    1.) Make a list of all of the activities necessary to help a client sell or buy 
    a house in your area. My list for sellers has 132 items on eight pages and it 
    visually blows clients away as to how much work is required. I have similar 
    lists of over 100 items for buyers, expired listings and for-sale-by-owners.<br />
    2.) Show pie charts about how small the commission really is to any one agent. 
    My listing pie starts out showing a hypothetical 6% commission being split in 
    half between the listing and selling brokers. Then it is reduced by a third for 
    the broker’s cut (use whatever percentage applies to you). Another third goes to 
    expenses leaving me with only one percent of the commission before taxes.<br />
    3.) Explain how much tax you pay on your net income. Don’t forget that most of 
    us pay about 28% federal tax plus a 15.3% self-employment tax and then add an 
    appropriate state tax. For me in California, it’s about 5% bringing my total tax 
    to nearly 50%. This means that I only receive about one-half of one percent of 
    the sales price of a house after taxes to feed my family and put a roof over our 
    heads. Once my clients understand that I get only about half a percent to do 
    over 100 activities they usually say that I’m underpaid as well as overworked 
    and the commission is no longer an issue.<br />
    4.) Don’t quote other brokers’ commissions. When a prospective seller asks you 
    how much you charge to sell a property only quote your half of the fee, which is 
    generally 2-3%. If the seller chooses to pay about the same or more to the 
    broker who brings the buyer, that’s his or her choice but none of your business. 
    In fact, by quoting both fees there can be an implication of subagency. Once 
    people recognize that each broker only gets half of the listing fee it reduces 
    the resistance substantially.<br />
    5.) Remember that most clients want quality first. Studies show that only 15% of 
    all consumers make a buying decision based primarily on lowest price, 80% are 
    concerned about quality more than price, and five percent want to pay a premium 
    price because it connotes prestige and possibly higher quality. So sell the 
    quality of your services to the 85% who will appreciate it.<br />
    6.) Develop a marketing plan that brings you more clients than you need. An 
    effective marketing plan enables you to pick and choose your clients. Obviously, 
    the first clients you want to eliminate are pure price shoppers. Also, rejecting 
    those who don’t value your services implies that you are a special and unique 
    agent who is in high demand. Exclusivity also implies higher quality.<br />
    7.) Show clients the thickness of a closed transaction file. It always amazes 
    the public to learn how much work is actually involved in putting together any 
    real estate deal. Explain that each document is there to protect the client’s 
    interests and to help meet their needs. Be careful not to violate any past 
    client’s privacy by showing sensitive documents but just seeing the volume of 
    paper should be sufficient to show that you do more than merely put a for-sale 
    sign on a seller’s house or drive buyers around to earn your fee.<br />
    8.) Never quote your commission until you have diagnosed the client’s need. Just 
    as a doctor would never prescribe treatment without doing tests to determine the 
    cause of an ailment, a real estate professional should not quote a fee until he 
    or she finds out the scope of the work to be done. Obviously, helping clients 
    conduct an IRS 1031 exchange is more work than a straight sale and a short sale 
    is more complex than a standard one. You may wish to charge a different fee 
    depending on the amount of work and expertise required. Also, if you quote your 
    fee at the beginning it focuses your whole relationship on cost rather than 
    service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

    <span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">
    More than ever, we must explain the value of our services to prospective 
    clients. Remember that most people assume that we get paid 6% or more and do 
    almost nothing to earn it so you might as well deal with the misimpression right 
    away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">
    Remember, it doesn’t take any special skill or training to be the cheapest agent 
    on the block. Sell the value of your services to those clients who appreciate it 
    and send the rest to someone who can’t justify his or her commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
