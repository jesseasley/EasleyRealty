        <span class="greenline">How to Create Your Successful 2008 Business Plan, Part 
        Two</span></h1>
    <p>
        As I said in part one, your 2007 is quickly coming to an end. It is a natural 
        lull and a perfect time to look at your business plan. Evaluate your progress 
        and evaluate the effectiveness of your plan. Or, if you did not create a 
        business plan at the beginning of the year, now is the perfect time to look at 
        your progress and begin to put an effective plan in place for 2008.</p>
    <p>
        Even if you have not completed part one you will find the information in part 
        two extremely valuable. In part one you determined how many appointments per 
        week with new people are required for you to hit your goals.</p>
    <p>
        For most of you it was less than two appointments per week. So consider that two 
        appointments per week with new buyers or sellers would lead you to sell more 
        Real Estate than ever before. This is simple but true for over 80% of the 
        agents.</p>
    <p>
        It is true provided that you have at least an adequate listing presentation and 
        buyer presentation.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>So here are the next questions in your Business Plan.</strong></p>
    <p>
        <strong>(1) Do you get</strong> more than half of the listings that you go on 
        presentations for?<br />
        <strong>(2) Do you sell</strong> more than half of the buyers that you start 
        working with?<br />
        <strong>(3) Are you showing</strong> less than ten houses to each buyer?<br />
        <strong>(4) Do most</strong> of your negotiations end in two rounds or less?</p>
    <p>
        If the answer to any of these questions is no, then working on strengthening 
        your presentations needs to be a goal in your business plan for this year.</p>
    <p>
        If the answer to all of these questions is yes, your presentations are strong. 
        You can skip to the section below on Marketing.</p>
    <p>
        Look at your listing presentation and decide what needs attention. Do you spend 
        enough time preparing, particularly preparing pricing? Do you build strong 
        rapport before you sit down? Do you have a marketing plan that you present with 
        strength and engage the seller as you present it? Are you confident in your 
        presentation of price? Do you ask for a decision to hire you?</p>
    <p>
        In your buyer presentation, do you meet with the buyer early in the 
        relationship? Do you ask a lot of questions about their wants, needs, and 
        lifestyle to identify their motivation and level of urgency? Do you review the 
        entire buying process and provide them with copies of all the documentation they 
        will see? Do you explain what they can expect from you and request what you 
        expect from them including their loyalty? Do you ensure that they are 
        financially qualified?</p>
    <p>
        There are ten questions here. As you look at your buyer and seller presentations 
        asking yourself these questions you will uncover other areas to strengthen. When 
        you show a property are you leading at first, then watching, and choosing when 
        to ask open ended questions, when to use tie down questions, when to use 
        alternative choices, and when to ask trial closing questions.</p>
    <p>
        - Do you show an average of more than five to ten properties to each buyer?<br />
        - Are you recognizing buying signs? When you see buying signs do you have 
        comfortable methodology to lead the buyers to sit down and write an offer?<br />
        - Do your negotiations go smoothly with you in control? Or do your negotiations 
        often go back and forth many times with parties getting upset with each other?</p>
    <p>
        I ask you these questions because we are building your plan for the year not 
        addressing the strengths and weaknesses that these answers reveal. As you answer 
        these questions make a list of the questions that reveal areas to address that 
        you are certain will make you more money, save you time, give you confidence and 
        peace of mind.</p>
    <p>
        Consider how to resolve the issues that these questions reveal. Where will you 
        learn the skill or gain the knowledge to strengthen the area you identify. Then 
        build that time to learn and grow stronger into your 2008 Business Plan.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Marketing</strong></p>
    <p>
        Have you sent any mailings this year? What business came from them?<br />
        What Web sites do you have? On what Web sites do your listings appear? What 
        other Web tools, services, or strategies have you employed? What leads have come 
        from them?<br />
        What advertising, particularly personal marketing ads have you done this year? 
        What results have you seen from them?</p>
    <p>
        Marketing can be either a strong foundation to your business with a huge return 
        on your investment in it or a money pit; which, the huge return or the money pit 
        completely depends on your marketing decisions.</p>
    <p>
        The key to good decision making with your marketing is simply to measure the 
        effectiveness of any marketing campaign by the results it brings you.</p>
    <p>
        Does your marketing lead to more appointments, sales and listings? If you follow 
        my instruction in part one regarding tracking your appointments you will be able 
        to determine this accurately and quickly enough to make effective and very cost 
        effective marketing decisions.</p>
    <p>
        Top agents market effectively, period. Lesser agents market less effectively. 
        This is the most important component to your lasting success.</p>
    <p>
        What marketing efforts do you want to continue for the balance of the year? What 
        efforts do you want to put permanently in place? What do you want to experiment 
        with?</p>
    <p>
        My experience with thousands of agents is that intelligent direct mail brings 
        the highest return. Smart Web strategies are second. Public media is usually a 
        distant third. There are exceptions.</p>
    <p>
        If you trust it you will probably have more success. Let your results in more 
        appointments, sales, and listings guide your decisions. To re-examine Part One,

        <strong>Quality Service</strong></p>
    <p>
        Repeat and referral business is the reward of your years in real estate. It is 
        not automatic. You get the reward of huge and ever increasing repeat and 
        referral business when you combine your marketing efforts (so people remember 
        you) and quality service?</p>
    <p>
        It is unfortunate but true that delivering quality service in Real Estate is not 
        enough. Many times the agent is doing a great job but is not communicating 
        regularly with the client. You have to both serve your clients well and 
        communicate regularly with them.</p>
    <p>
        Quality service starts with your first contact and continues forever.</p>
    <p>
        Do you get back to people in a timely manner? Do you get back to people when you 
        say you will? Do you speak to your listed sellers weekly; so they are confident 
        in your efforts? Do you communicate weekly with clients who have pending 
        transactions so they know that you are there for them protecting their interests 
        to the end and beyond?</p>
    <p>
        Do you describe your service in detail in your listing and buyer presentations? 
        Do you speak regularly to the people to whom you are sending new listings? Do 
        you pay extra attention and step up your contact between mortgage commitment and 
        closing? Do you stay in touch a few times the first month the person is in their 
        new home?</p>
    <p>
        This earns you the right to stay in touch comfortably forever. What system do 
        you use to track your contact and the progress of your listings and pendings?</p>
    <p>
        As you look at these questions what are the top three things that if put them in 
        place are most likely to significantly increase your client satisfaction next 
        year? You may already realize that this higher level of service also results in 
        more peace of mind for you and more repeat and referral business forever?</p>
    <p>
        If you are beginning to despair over learning all of these things, building all 
        of these skills and systems you are normal.</p>
    <p>
        What you will find is that just being aware of these things will add 
        significantly to your success. Creating the plan adds more. Continually taking 
        action on the plan is the habit and practice of the highest producers.</p>
    <p>
        It is simply smart, consistent work with strong self belief. If you question 
        your ability to implement the work or strengthen your self esteem; that is 
        exactly what our coaching relationships do for you.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Your Winning Results</strong></p>
    <p>
        Complete these parts of your Business Plan; your Presentations, Marketing and 
        Service. Working on each of these parts leads to more business in any market. 
        These are truly the heart and core of your business. That deserves repeating. 
        Your Presentations, Your Marketing and Your Service are the core, the heart of 
        your business.</p>
    <p>
        My top clients never stop working on these three skills and systems. They 
        continuously improve their presentations, expand and enhance their marketing and 
        add quality to their service while streamlining it and delegating parts of it. 
        Once you have chosen the areas that you are going to work on, set goals for 
        those areas by year’s end and actually schedule time in your calendar to achieve 
        these goals.</p>
