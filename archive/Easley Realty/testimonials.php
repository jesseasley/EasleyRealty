            My family and I were moving out of state two years ago and it
            couldn't have been at a worse time as far as the real estate
            market was concerned.  When we decided to move, we engaged
            Jess Easley as our real estate agent to help us sell our home.
            He walked us through the process and answered all our questions.
            Although our expectations were unreasonable in hindsight, Jess
            stood by our decisions on our asking price.  He told us that the market would probably not support our asking price but he
            was willing to do what he could.
            <br>
              <br>
                After several weeks and price adjustments, there was little
                hope in getting what we thought to be a decent price.  We asked
                Jess about leasing out the house and he agreed to manage our
                property.  At this point, he became more of a partner than
                just an agent.  We were able to lease our house for several
                months until the market started to turn around.  When we felt
                it was time, we had Jess relist the property and we finally
                sold our home for close to what we were hoping for.
                <br>
                  <br>
                    During our partnership with Jess, we felt very comfortable
                    knowing that someone was looking out for us and our home
                    while we lived 700 miles away.  Whenever a problem or issue
                    arose, Jess was always willing to get to the house and set
                    our minds at ease.  When it came to pricing and listing the
                    house, Jess advised us but made sure we had the final say
                    on all matters.  If we were not as stubborn, we would have
                    sold our home much sooner but we were glad to have Jess
                    watching out for us.
                    <br>

    A very satisfied client.

        Working with Jess Easley on the sale of our home was easy.
        During the difficult years of house sales he took his job
        seriously yet was honest to his word. When we told him he'd
        have to sale the house "as is" because, although it was
        not a foreclosure, we simply did not have the time, energy
        or resources to do any fix-up, he understood and never
        tried to pressure us on changes even though several weeks
        passed before an offer came in.
        <br>
          <br>
													We appreciated his efforts and support in trying to decide 
													on our future destination. His time and promptness proved 
													his dedication and made us feel like a priority on his busy schedule.

        I had a great experience working with Jess Easley.
        I was a first time home buyer and Jess did a good job
        getting me the answers to all my questions. He made it
        seem simple and is very easy-going. I would definitely
        recommend Jess to anyone.

        I appreciate your EMAILs very much, and I want to tell you how a previous
        message about getting your house in "curb-appeal" order helped in the case of
        the front door, as you advised specifically about.
        <br>
          <br>
            Our door looked terrible, and all the "varnished" doors are getting to look
            the same inÂ our subdivision, the result of improper pre-treatment and poor
            varnish applications by the builder. Well, I sanded and scraped, but still the
            door looked like a poor candidate for re-staining and re-varnishing, especially
            since the dark surface mildew so common to fencing had appeared in areas. I also
            don't entertain the idea of removing my front door to do a full removal since
            it's the primary gateway to my home's security.
            <br>
              <br>
													Well, I went to Sherwin Williams and got some crabapple-colored darkish red 
													enamel, and I wound up painting the thing, and it looks great! Yes, it looks 
													great not only from the curb but from drive-by views as well.Thanks for the advice, Jess! You know, I've gone to countless garage, 
													estate and in-home sales, and some of these places leave you with the opinion 
													of, "who would want to buy this place?". That's why your advice is so 
													well-appreciated.
