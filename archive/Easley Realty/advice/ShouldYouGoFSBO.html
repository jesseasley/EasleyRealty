        <h2>
            Should You Go FSBO?</h2>
        <p>
            Pronounced “fizzbo,” an FSBO (for sale by owner) is a Realtor acronym for a 
            property that an individual is looking to sell on their own.</p>
        <p>
            To a certain extent, the notion may be driven by tough economic times. With 
            equity evaporating in many markets, it might be a necessity for some sellers to 
            go the DIY route. It is a question brought about by the perception of high cost 
            for very little real work and a nagging sense that, hey, maybe I could do that.</p>
        <p>
            Maybe you can. Maybe you shouldn’t.</p>
        <p>
            The market, motivation, familiarity with the process, knowledge of real estate 
            law, disposition, time, and resources should all be considered before you begin 
            the process of selling your own home.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>The Market</strong></p>
        <p>
            They don’t call them buyers and sellers markets for nothing, and, to a large 
            extent, market conditions are often mostly local. A gripping nationwide 
            recession, industry-wide job losses, and lenders’ unwillingness to lend, tend to 
            have nationwide implications. But, even at the darkest of times, there are 
            pockets of prosperity where demand for housing is high. In most cases, even if 
            you over or under estimate the price, the market will eventually catch up to 
            you.</p>
        <p>
            Not so in a declining market. If you don’t get the price right, you will be 
            chasing the market down. Before listing your own home, you need access to good 
            current data about sales prices, market times, and activity. Assuming a modest 
            sixty day market time, you still need to analyze past sales to determine what 
            the value will be in 60 days or more, before a buyer commits.</p>
        <p>
            If you are unrealistic about price, you have no chance. The notion that a 
            prospective home buyer is going to stroll down your street and fall in love with 
            your house is a fantasy. The objective is to price the home for a quick sale but 
            not leave money on the table. It’s a fine line that only an experienced 
            professional, armed with facts, can determine.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Motivation</strong></p>
        <p>
            If at all possible, you should avoid selling into a buyer’s market. If you do 
            not have to sell, don’t, unless you are doing so to buy something else. You also 
            have to be willing to take the hit on your opinion of value and make it up on 
            the bargain you are buying. If you must sell, be realistic about your situation 
            and take your markdown sooner rather than later.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Familiarity with the process</strong></p>
        <p>
            There are two types of FSBOs; the ones who know it all and the ones who don’t 
            know anything, and it isn’t uncommon for FSBOs to be engaged in the industry 
            because they aren’t intimidated by the process.</p>
        <p>
            The process appears daunting because it is, but it isn’t unmanageable. The basic 
            issues are either contractual or regulatory, and there seems to be a tendency 
            among novices to assume that selling real estate to someone is just like selling 
            a used dishwasher.</p>
        <p>
            As the seller, you will need to fulfill numerous legal and regulatory conditions 
            applicable to the state in which the property is located. The consequences for 
            failing to be in compliance are rather harsh. Before listing your home on your 
            own, be familiar with the process and know the requirements for your state.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Knowledge of real estate law</strong></p>
        <p>
            Some sellers believe that because they are not licensed, laws and regulations do 
            not apply to them. Ignorance of the law is a major hurdle. Unless they 
            specialize, most attorneys don’t know much about real estate law. On the other 
            hand, responsible real estate brokerages make a practice of avoiding litigation 
            by knowing and complying with the law. Today’s real estate transaction files are 
            an inch and a half thick and weigh three pounds, and it is all driven by 
            caution. Know the law, or hire someone who does.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Disposition</strong></p>
        <p>
            Most people, even practitioners, haven’t the proper disposition for selling real 
            estate, let alone their own property. The job of real estate requires a lot of 
            patience while you deal with prospective homebuyers, until one transforms into a 
            paying client. People who are buying or selling real estate are under a lot of 
            stress. There is the stress of uncertainty and the underlying events driving 
            their decisions.</p>
        <p>
            There is also a lot of raw emotion throughout the home buying and selling 
            process. Well trained professionals do not surrender control of their emotions 
            to events or the actions of others.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Time</strong></p>
        <p>
            Time is of the essence. It isn’t just a legal phrase, you will need to invest 
            time to market the property and be available to show your home and respond to 
            any inquiries. Your time does have value which can be earned through the 
            investment of the time in something profitable or the value of time for leisure 
            and enjoyment. If the home doesn’t sell quickly, you aren’t likely to recoup the 
            value of your time in savings.</p>
        <p>
            Being on the market longer won’t get you a higher offer either; it will just eat 
            away at your equity.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Resources</strong></p>
        <p>
            How will potential buyers know about your property? A homemade sign in the front 
            yard is effective only if the potential buyer happens to drive down your street.</p>
        <p>
            The best kept secret in real estate is that if the property is priced to reflect 
            true market value and it is placed in the multiple listing service, nothing will 
            stop it from selling. Sooner or later, every buyer turns to the MLS, if for no 
            other reason than to prove to themselves that there is no better home out there. 
            The challenge for a FSBO is to find a method as cost effective as the MLS.</p>
        <p>
            Looking at the bigger picture, it is hard to imagine that someone would want to 
            take the risks and the responsibility of selling for sale by owner unless they 
            were certain they would net significantly more money upon closing. But, that 
            rarely happens. Most, ultimately wind up engaging the services of a professional 
            after wasting time and money. In a declining market, every month you don’t sell 
            means a lower market value. And, if you are making mortgage payments, each 
            payment is lowering your net equity. A fast sale is the most profitable sale.</p>
        <p>
            One thing you are likely to discover is that real estate practitioners produce 
            more potential buyers then you will. In fact, those FSBOs who do succeed often 
            wind up paying at least half of the brokerage fee to the broker who produces a 
            buyer. So, at best, you won’t be able to influence a higher than market value, 
            you will likely pay a partial fee and, if that isn’t bad enough, the buyer of a 
            FSBO also intends to pocket the brokerage fee. Like so many things, it really is 
            harder than it looks.</p>
        <p>
            Before selling your own home, interview a few brokers and get their opinions of 
            value and overview of the market. If one is particularly helpful, you might want 
            to consider listing with them if the home doesn’t sell quickly. And, remember 
            what lawyers say, “Any attorney who would represent himself has a fool for a 
            client.”</p>
