    <b><font face="Arial" size="2">BY MICHAEL ANTONIAK </font></b>
    <br />
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman">Web tools and services have gotten more 
    sophisticated, so you can do much more to stand out and needn’t be a tech genius 
    to do it.</font><br />
    <br />
    <b><font face="Times New Roman">Case in point:</font></b><font 
        face="Times New Roman"> At </font><a href="http://www.thepasalagroup.com/" 
        target="new"><u><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">The Pasala 
    Group’s Web site</font></u></a><font face="Times New Roman">, sales associate 
    Jim Pasala steps onto the lower right of the home page, appearing nearly 3-D, as 
    he directs you to what his business has to offer. The walk-on video, a product 
    of Innovate Media, conveys the professionalism Pasala hopes to project as a 
    specialist in luxury homes with Coldwell Banker Previews International in 
    Newport Beach, Calif.</font><br />
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman">“I want people to see me as being on the cutting 
    edge of technology,” says Pasala, who’s invested nearly $10,000 on his Web site. 
    “I use video because it gives people a much better idea of the appeal of homes.” 
    He plans to add video testimonials of clients talking about his company’s 
    services and the community.</font><br />
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman">Like Pasala, real estate practitioners are tapping 
    Web tools and templates to shape perceptions and deliver content to make their 
    Web sites attractive destinations for those shopping or selling property. Online 
    components include everything from routine features like property searches and 
    seller-targeted e-mail marketing alerts to providing technology information and 
    showcasing exceptional properties with walk-through virtual tours.</font><br />

    <font face="Times New Roman">Sales associate Kiran Vedantam, of the Kiran &amp; 
    Kiran team at Call Realty in Phoenix, credits his weekly blog, hosted by

        face="Times New Roman">, </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">for driving 
    prospects to his site.</font><br />
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman">“Most people realize they can search the MLS on any 
    Web site,” Vedantam says. “So with my blog I try to give buyers and sellers 
    something more. The blog is a way people can find me when searching the Internet 
    for information about this area. Then they keep returning to my site to find out 
    what’s new.”</font><br />

    <b><font face="Arial">Web Essentials </font></b>
    <br />
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman">Before adding all the bells and whistles to your 
    Web site, make sure you’ve covered these basics: </font>
    <br />
    <br />
    <b><font face="Times New Roman">Beyond search results </font></b>
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman">Most people visit a real estate Web site to see 
    what property is available and what it’s selling for. But since they can get 
    that from your competitors’ sites, you’ll want to make their search results on 
    your site more relevant. Add driving directions, community and neighborhood 
    information, quick tips for buyers and sellers, loan calculators, and a rundown 
    of what’s sold in recent weeks.</font><br />
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman">Easy navigation Include links throughout your site 
    and give your site’s menus and buttons concise and descriptive labels so people 
    know what they’re clicking on. Consistent menus on every page establish a 
    unified look.</font><br />
    <br />
    <b><font face="Times New Roman">Simplicity </font></b>
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman">Avoid the temptation to overwhelm visitors with 
    lots of flashy multimedia animation and sound. If you can’t resist, at least 
    allow those who won’t be impressed to skip over your multimedia intro and move 
    directly to the information they want.</font><br />
    <br />
    <b><font face="Times New Roman">Regular updates </font></b>
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman">Keep people coming to your site by adding new 
    content and rearranging articles and pictures for an updated look throughout the 
    year. Plus, updating your Web site frequently can help boost your site’s search 
    engine placement.</font><br />
    <br />
    <b><font face="Times New Roman">Quick response </font></b>
    <br />
    <font face="Times New Roman">The whole point of your Web site is to motivate 
    prospects to place a call or send you an e-mail. Once they’ve taken that 
    initiative, return their message as soon as possible—before they stray to a 
    competitor’s Web site.</font><br />
