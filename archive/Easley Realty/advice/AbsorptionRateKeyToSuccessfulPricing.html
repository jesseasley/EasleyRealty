    <font face="Arial" size="2">Telling sellers the price they want to hear may get 
    you the listing, but it won’t sell the home, Zan Monroe, ABR®, CRB, CRS®, said 
    during a presentation at the 2007 REALTORS® Conference &amp; Expo on Tuesday.</font><br />
    <br />
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Only pricing the listing right will do that, said 
    Monroe, whose comic presentation style had the audience in stitches. And the 
    right price depends in large part on the current absorption rate in your market. 
    Here’s how you find that: </font>
    <br />
    <ul>
        <li type="disc"><font face="Arial" size="2">First, determine the number of homes 
            closed in your market over a specific period — say, 12 months. You can get this 
            data from the MLS. </font></li>
        <li type="disc"><font face="Arial" size="2">Next, divide the number of homes by the 
            number of months in the period — in this case, 12. This calculation gives a per 
            month absorption rate.</font> </li>
        <li type="disc"><font face="Arial" size="2">Last, divide the rate into the number of 
            current listings. This yields the months’ supply of homes.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Six months’ supply is considered a balanced market — 
    when the number of listings roughly equals the number of buyers, says Monroe. 
    Numbers over six represent a buyers’ market and those below a sellers’ market.</font><br />
    <br />
    <font face="Arial" size="2">To assess sales trends, you can also calculate 
    supply over shorter six- and three-month periods. “Price in real estate is 
    mostly a matter of supply and demand, just like in every other industry,” said 
    Monroe.</font><br />
    <br />
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Once you have these basic calculations down pat, you 
    can focus on absorption in particular neighborhoods or price ranges, says 
    Monroe. Showing clients local absorption rates will give sellers the information 
    they need to price their homes to sell. “Once they’ve arrived at a price, you 
    can decide whether you want to spend your marketing dollars selling it,” says 
    Monroe. If they don’t price it realistically, he concluded, then seriously 
    consider taking a pass on the listing. </font>
    <br />
    <br />
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Monroe also explained how to calculate the odds of 
    selling any one home. “Even in a hot market, it’s rare for more than 50 percent 
    of homes to sell,” he said. To make this calculation:</font><br />
    <ul>
        <li type="disc"><font face="Arial" size="2">Search the MLS to determine how many 
            transactions have closed in the last six months.</font> </li>
        <li type="disc"><font face="Arial" size="2">Divide that number by the number of
            </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2">new </font></i><font face="Arial" 
                size="2">listing that came onto the market during the same six months. 
            (Don’t include listings that expired and then were relisted.)</font></li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <font face="Arial" size="2">This equation gives you the percentage of homes 
    entering the market that actually sold. For example, if 100 homes sold and 200 
    were listed, the odds of selling are 50 percent.</font><br />
