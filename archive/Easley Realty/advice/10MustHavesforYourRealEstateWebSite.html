<p>
    Today’s most successful agents no longer play games with customers to get their 
    business. There is no such thing anymore as too much information. These days, 
    withholding information makes us less valuable to potential clients, not more.</p>
<p>
    The good news is that you can harness the vast amount of data and information 
    your clients - and potential clients - need and want all in one place. From new 
    buyers to empty nesters, your Web site should be a one-stop resource that 
    answers every possible question a customer might have. How much information 
    should you provide to the consumer? The only answer is “all.” When the time 
    comes to buy or sell, or that person has a question specific to their situation, 
    your phone will start ringing.</p>
<p>
    The following 10 concepts capitalize on that idea and will do wonders to not 
    only drive traffic to your Web site but to convert that traffic into clients and 
    future referrals. You will see quite a bit of overlap among these 10 items. 
    Integrated well with one another, these tools will make you stand out from the 
    crowded field of agents looking to get new business.</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. Offer an exhaustive search capability</strong>.<br />
    The days of having an Internet brochure or holding 24-hour Internet open houses 
    are well over. Although exclusively displaying your listings, highlighting how 
    much real estate you’ve sold in the past and posting pictures of your expensive 
    car or family and pets might be interesting to look at, they do little to 
    generate leads, provide timely information or educate a prospective client.</p>
<p>
    Consumers want access to all listings all the time and have the ability to 
    search in numerous ways. Your Web site should have an IDX (Internet Data 
    Exchange) search that provides numerous criteria to search with, at the minimum, 
    the capacity to search by ZIP code, subdivision name, city, county, school 
    district, street name and street number - or any combination of those. It should 
    also have an automated new listings report so that it’s always up to date.</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. Construct pre-defined searches</strong>.<br />
    If you live in a metropolitan area that has popular places buyers tend to ask 
    for by name - the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago or a large, well-known 
    subdivision or high-rise, for example - prominently feature a heading on your 
    search page that says, “Search these popular areas now.” Then individually list 
    the areas as buttons or hyperlinks. The customer can then click on the button 
    and go straight to a predefined MLS query and pull a blanket search for every 
    property in that in-demand area. Prospective buyers can then drill down and 
    filter their results by whichever criteria they want because you already offer 
    an exhaustive search capability (see No. 1).</p>
<p>
    Some agents have made a lucrative specialty of seeking leads for a narrowly 
    tailored pre-defined search such as homes with swimming pools, lake homes, 
    golf-course homes and vacation properties. Some even dedicate a separate Web 
    site to them.</p>
<p>
    <strong>If there aren’t a lot of standout neighborhoods, sections of town or 
    buildings in your listing area, pre-define your searches in other creative ways, 
    such as by</strong>:</p>
<p>
    <strong>• Style of home</strong> (ranch, split-level, two-story, bungalow, 
    multifamily, etc.)<br />
    <strong>•</strong> <strong>Build date<br />
    • Architectural style<br />
    • Homes that only have a first-floor master bedroom</strong></p>
<p>
    You can also create specialty links that feature these types of properties 
    within certain geographical areas. By offering pre-defined searches, you’re 
    providing the consumer the wherewithal to do the best-defined search possible 
    for their individual needs. As any buyer will tell you, there’s nothing worse 
    than click-click-clicking through scores of properties just to find a few decent 
    listings. Instead, you’re giving prospective clients a fast, efficient, targeted 
    search, which they will appreciate.</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. Employ interactive mapping</strong>.<br />
    For the buyers from out of town who don’t know the area they’re moving to, 
    interactive mapping is an invaluable tool. While friends, co-workers and other 
    real estate agents might suggest cross streets to begin a buyer’s search, such 
    word-of-mouth informality only goes so far.</p>
<p>
    However, when armed with those cross streets and the right technology, visitors 
    to your site can now draw a boundary, and the MLS can then hone in on that exact 
    predefined area. To make your information even more robust, add satellite, 
    street or aerial views, topography or a combination of any of the four. Included 
    with these views should be demographic information such as average age, income, 
    education levels and nearby services and attractions.</p>
<p>
    An interactive mapping search is the easiest kind to conduct for most people. 
    Once the visitor has an area to look at, they can filter the search further by 
    number of bedrooms and bathrooms, price or other criteria, yet another way to 
    deepen your predefined search offerings.</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. Provide compelling and relevant visual content</strong>.<br />
    Prospective buyers want the most visual content they can get their hands on: 
    multiple still photos, panoramic 360-degree views, virtual tours and video. Most 
    recent reports and association studies have proven beyond a doubt that the more 
    pictures an agent puts into a listing, the more traffic and views that property 
    will generate - which translates to more and better leads. In general, a 
    property with six or more pictures will generate up to six times the traffic of 
    a listing that has just one.</p>
<p>
    There’s nothing more irritating to a buyer than clicking on a listing and seeing 
    just one photo - a bad one at that - of the home’s backyard. There are no 
    interior shots to give an idea of the home’s condition, floor plan or amenities. 
    The frustrated prospective buyer or her agent will simply say, “Next!” and move 
    on to the next Web site immediately. The ability to look at, say, a virtual 
    tour, allows buyers to eliminate or choose a property quickly. Out of 100 
    listings, they can quickly identify their top five or 10.</p>
<p>
    Instead of wasting time driving to appointments, a buyer can drill down within a 
    matter of a few hours to establish a short list of highly desirable properties. 
    Ideally, the buyer goes online, conducts all the research on his own, calls an 
    agent - hopefully you! - looks at the five houses on his short list and buys one 
    of them. By anyone’s math, that approach is far more efficient than taking five 
    different days driving around after work or on the weekend looking at a laundry 
    list of “sort of right” houses. As an agent, you save money because you’re now 
    more productive and your return on investment is much greater - all because you 
    passively provided an abundance of information to a complete stranger.</p>
<p>
    One note of caution: When it comes to visual content, leave it to a 
    professional. Using low-quality photography and video will cancel out any 
    advantage putting photos, tours or video into the listing might have otherwise 
    provided.</p>
<p>
    <strong>5. Make your site the local authority on community and lifestyle 
    information</strong>.<br />
    When buyers are actively searching, they not only imagine themselves living in 
    the house itself but being part of the community in which it’s located. What 
    will my neighbors be like? Where is the grocery store? Are there a lot of 
    children in the neighborhood? How many renters live in the vicinity? Is the 
    neighborhood governed by a homeowner association? On many levels, the decision 
    to buy a house frequently boils down to emotion over logic. To accommodate those 
    considerations, an agent’s Web site must provide information that answers all of 
    those questions.</p>
<p>
    Weaving this concept back into interactive mapping, perhaps include a panoramic 
    virtual tour of the neighborhood; an interactive map that highlights points of 
    interest such as hospitals, schools, places of worship and shopping. Couple 
    these map points with a neighborhood history and biography that gives buyers a 
    feel for its personality. Is it a younger, more active area with a vibrant night 
    life? Or is it a bedroom community where young families move to raise their 
    kids? Try including testimonials from select neighbors and offering suggestions 
    for the top 10 shops or restaurants.</p>
<p>
    Right now, few agents - less than 1%- are doing this. By integrating 
    information, photography and mapping, you’ve given this buyer an initial tour of 
    the neighborhood and a feel for its residents and their lifestyles; everything 
    they would do if they were visiting in person. This kind of informational depth 
    is especially valuable to the buyer moving from out of state. The more interest 
    you create, the more psychological ownership buyers will take, which will make 
    earning their business a little easier.</p>
<p>
    <strong>6. Give your site’s visitors an Ivy League real estate education</strong>.<br />
    The old agent model was to be light on information and detail and heavy on 
    direct response. Today, the opposite is true. To be successful, agents must have 
    comprehensive information about the home buying and selling processes. What is 
    preapproval? Is that the same as prequalifying? What is a home inspection? Is 
    that the same as an appraisal? Inexperienced buyers want an extremely broad 
    A-to-Z overview of what it takes to buy or sell a home. Remove the mystery.</p>
<p>
    As you educate prospective buyers, you’re building loyalty without even having a 
    relationship. If your Web site can be the first place they think to go to when 
    they want information, chances are pretty good that you’re going to get their 
    business.</p>
<p>
    A healthy percentage of buyers are first-timers. They are going through an 
    education process that might start 12 months before they are ready to ask for an 
    agent’s assistance. And they’re not just finding areas they like and eliminating 
    homes but also learning the actual process of buying a home from offer to 
    closing. Why not be the one who teaches them? The ability to pull down detailed 
    information that educates them about this sometimes intimidating process can be 
    extremely reassuring and helpful.</p>
<p>
    There are many convenient delivery methods for your information. PDF reports 
    allow buyers to download the information to their computer and read or print it 
    at their convenience. You can make the home-buying process a “class” where you 
    offer a different “lecture” every week via a pod cast buyers can download and 
    listen to, again at their convenience. Or you can teach the process using a 
    combination of video, audio and PowerPoint slides. You can also very 
    inexpensively use any number of Flash video software to do 15-minute vignettes 
    on buying and selling. The possibilities are limited only by what you can 
    imagine. You can also use the education process as a lead-generation device by 
    offering signups for your weekly or monthly “classes” on buying and selling.</p>
<p>
    <strong>7. Offer nonintrusive lead-generation forms</strong>.<br />
    Requiring an upfront lead-generation form as an information exchange tool is an 
    outdated tactic. Instead, think of these forms as offering the buyer a chance to 
    raise his hand and ask you for help. You are showering perfect strangers with 
    the gift of robust, abundant information all throughout your site. When 
    prospects have questions, they won’t be afraid to ask you for assistance because 
    you’ve already been helping them. With so much information on your site, you’re 
    giving them reason to interact with you.</p>
<p>
    Though you’re providing information, you still need to have the ability to 
    interact and know who’s coming to your Web site. Your Web site is a sales tool, 
    so use it that way. Throughout your site, offer - but don’t force - prospective 
    buyers to ask you for more information. Though you’ve likely answered a majority 
    of their questions with the wealth of information you’ve already provided, they 
    may still have questions or requests.</p>
<p>
    Scatter information request forms throughout your interactive Web site. To make 
    it easier to decide what to ask for; <strong>the most common questions and 
    requests often include</strong>:</p>
<p>
    • <strong>How much</strong> is my home worth?<br />
    • <strong>Will you send</strong> me more in-depth information on a particular 
    property?<br />
    • <strong>Will you conduct</strong> a comparative market analysis (i.e. a home 
    evaluation)?<br />
    • <strong>Will you sign me up</strong> for new listings reports via e-mail?<br />
    • <strong>Will you alert me</strong> when podcasts or other educational 
    materials become available?<br />
    • <strong>Will you send me</strong> a relocation package?<br />
    • <strong>Can you set</strong> up a viewing appointment for a particular 
    property?<br />
    • <strong>Can you prequalify</strong> me?<br />
    • <strong>I have</strong> a home to sell before I buy. Help!</p>
<p>
    When a user is ready to make those kinds of requests, you will often be the 
    first person they think of. Why? Because you’ve spent months planting seeds with 
    them through your Web site’s content instead of wasting time cold-calling a pile 
    of low-quality leads. Offering several ways for visitors to transition from 
    passively looking at your site to actively seeking your expertise for even the 
    smallest question can quickly turn into new business. They’ve now come to you 
    instead of you going to them.</p>
<p>
    <strong>8. Use objective data and third-party testimonials</strong>.<br />
    Real estate ranks in the bottom five of all industries for trustworthiness - 
    right alongside attorneys and used-car salesmen. We’re also a very egotistical 
    industry. Avoid the temptation of having 10 pages on your Web site devoted to 
    telling visitors how fabulous you are, how many homes you’ve sold and the number 
    of dollars you’ve generated. When you build yourself up like that, many 
    prospective buyers will think, “That agent’s too busy for me. I’m not going to 
    call.”</p>
<p>
    Over hyping yourself drives as much business away as it might bring in. 
    Remember: It’s not about you, it’s about the property. Instead, illustrate your 
    value with objective data and testimonials from happy clients.</p>
<p>
    It’s good to talk about the value of a Realtor® - how using one can save or make 
    money for buyers and sellers. The approach you choose, however, will make all 
    the difference. Instead of saying, “I sold $2 million worth of real estate last 
    year,” <strong>it’s much more compelling to say</strong>:</p>
<p>
    • “<strong>On average</strong>, buyers who worked with me in 2006 saved $6,472.”<br />
    • “<strong>I worked with</strong> 26 sellers in the past year and, on average, 
    got them 98 percent of their asking price.”<br />
    • “<strong>Last year</strong>, I worked with 32 buyers. Of those, I averaged a 
    savings of 12 percent off the listing price.”</p>
<p>
    You’re showing customers in a powerful, concrete, provable way that you have 
    real value and that your services can often pay for themselves. No one can argue 
    with that.</p>
<p>
    In addition to using data, put genuine, heartfelt third-party testimonials on 
    your site. Every time you have a happy client at the closing table, put them on 
    camera. Visit the family of first-time buyers on their moving day. Make an 
    emotional connection with future buyers and sellers. Allow them to imagine 
    themselves sitting at the same closing table or loading the moving truck. In a 
    relationship business like ours, there’s nothing more powerful.</p>
<p>
    <strong>9. Learn and implement Internet syndication</strong>.<br />
    Your Web site should feed, or propagate, your listing information to numerous 
    other sites on the Internet such as Yahoo!, Trulia, Google Base, Craig’s List, 
    Oodle and Live Deal. With live feeds, every time you put a listing on your site, 
    it automatically syndicates to these other sites. Such movement will amplify 
    each listing’s impact, increasing the number and quality of your leads 
    substantially. For those agents who are less technologically inclined, 
    syndication is easy to set up through a good Internet developer. With many 
    vendors, syndication comes as part of a whole Web site package.</p>
<p>
    Now that you’re syndicating your listings, you can accurately quantify and 
    qualify where your traffic is coming from. This is especially helpful for those 
    agents who have a limited marketing budget. With metrics in place, you can spend 
    more money on sites that get more traffic and cut back on others that don’t.</p>
<p>
    <strong>10. Build a robust administrative/back-page area for your site</strong>.<br />
    <strong>No lead-generation Web site would be complete without an exhaustive 
    backsite that</strong>:</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Houses all</strong> incoming leads<br />
    • <strong>Has a contact</strong> management capability where you can search by 
    last name, ZIP code, price range and MLS number<br />
    • <strong>Has listing management</strong> functions for all of your individual 
    listings including adding and deleting photos and banners, changing descriptions 
    and price, managing virtual tours, etc.<br />
    • <strong>Has a lead follow-up</strong> system that allows you to create 
    campaigns, track online viewing habits and develops a profile for each visitor<br />
    • <strong>Can automatically send</strong> select clients information about 
    events in a neighborhood, such as a new restaurant opening<br />
    • <strong>Can send automated e-mails</strong> asking how a client’s search is 
    going or offering more educational information such as, “10 things you need to 
    do before writing an offer”<br />
    • <strong>Houses your</strong> monthly newsletter</p>
<p>
    Look at everything on your back-page area with an eye toward touching base, 
    educating, assisting with searches and providing neighborhood and lifestyle 
    information for each of your clients.</p>
